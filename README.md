# Layoffs-EDA-with-SQL
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of job layoffs using SQL to uncover key trends and insights. The dataset includes information on layoffs across various industries, locations, and time periods. Through this analysis, we aim to identify patterns, highlight correlations, and provide data-driven insights into the factors contributing to workforce reductions.

Key Features:

<li>Data Cleaning: Preprocessed and cleaned the layoff dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.</li>
<li>SQL Queries: Developed advanced SQL queries for data filtering, aggregation, and summarization of layoff trends.</li>
<li>Trend Analysis: Analyzed industry-specific layoffs, identifying high-risk sectors and seasonal patterns.</li>
<li>Visualizations: Generated visual summaries and insights to make the analysis more accessible.</li>
<li>Reporting: Provided detailed reports showcasing key findings and insights derived from the data.</li>
