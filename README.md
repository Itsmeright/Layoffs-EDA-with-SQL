# Layoffs-EDA-with-SQL
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of job layoffs using SQL to uncover key trends and insights. The dataset includes information on layoffs across various industries, locations, and time periods. Through this analysis, we aim to identify patterns, highlight correlations, and provide data-driven insights into the factors contributing to workforce reductions.
